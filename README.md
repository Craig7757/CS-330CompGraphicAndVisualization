# CS-330CompGraphicAndVisualization

This scene was made to represent a picture I took:

THis picture contained basic shapes as well as compound objects on a plain. 
This project was coded using OpenGl.

My attempt is posted below.

My recreation stands in stark contrast to the image it is trying to emulate. 

The color and texturing is off, but the key elements in the scene are still represented. The plain, two compound objects and 2 simple objects.
The color is due to the aditional lighting.
